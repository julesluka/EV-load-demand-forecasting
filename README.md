# EV-load-demand-forecasting

Normal and weibull distribution are used to determine the power demand and charging duration respectively. 
An aggregator function is used to sum the power levels on the horizontal time frame. 
The aggregated power level is sampled at 15 minutes interval to predict the daily load curve on an 
electrical vehicle charging station.
